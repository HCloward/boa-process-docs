### Enhancement and New Features

Include "Refer to" statement and a link to relevant use case in release
notes announcing enhancements or new features.

For example:

Fields can now be deleted from a System. Fields that have been deleted
from a System appear as Deprecated on the Fields tab of the Data Set
detail page. A filter for Depreciated fields has been added to the Data
Set detail page on the Fields Tab.

Refer to [Import fields to a System]{.underline} and [Set up Data
Sets]{.underline} for more information.
