Styles
------

Use the default style sheet in Flare. Generally accepted technical
writing style standards for writing use cases apply. Use bold text
(only) for options (links, icons, etc) that are a recipient of a user
action in a use case. Don't bold references to options outside of a use
case. Notable difference between the DSP Help style and IGCâ„¢ Help style
is that in IGC Help you do not use italics for page names or any other
text.

For example:

Click **Quick Add**.

**NOTE**: To access the term after you click Quick Add, search for the
term.

You can refer to the Set Up Terms topic in help as a good use case
example.
