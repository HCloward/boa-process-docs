### GIFs

Use sparingly. Do not use for CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
functionality. A GIF showing a form being completed and a Save option
being clicked is not necessary to understanding or engaging to a reader.

You can read the Visual Designer Overview topic in the online Help
system to see examples of two properly formatted and sized gifs.

Use a 400 pixel max width. Smaller gifs are fine as long as they are
easy to see and fit in the frame or window for of the Help system.

You can use LICECap to record gifs. Download LICECap here:

You can use GIMP, an open-source image manipulation program, to record
or edit GIF size. GIMP can do a lot of work Photoshop does. GIMP's
