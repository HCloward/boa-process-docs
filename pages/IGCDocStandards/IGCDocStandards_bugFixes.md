### Bug Fixes

Try to keep notes for bug fixes simple and limited to one sentence. If
the way in which the issue was fixed is a change for the user, you can
mention it in the note with "by."

For example:

It might help the reader to know that the related asset name is now
being truncated.

\[IGC-1054\] -- Fixed an issue where long asset names were causing a
horizontal scroll bar for related assets on the asset detail page by
truncating the name of the related asset.

The reader does not necessary need to know that the misalignment was
fixed by resizing a div container.

\[IGC-1157\] - Fixed an issue where the plus sign was misaligned on the
Add icon on the Data Set detail page Add Fields tab.
