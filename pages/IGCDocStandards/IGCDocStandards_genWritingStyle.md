IGC™ Documentation Style Guide
==============================

Follow these guidelines when writing Help content for Information
Governance Cloud (IGC )™.

General Writing Style
---------------------

If not listed here, follow the *Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical
Publications* for general technical writing guidelines. Use the
*BackOffice Associates® Documentation Standard*s for BOA specific style
standards, such as trademarks/registrations and product name
conventions.

Guidelines:

-   Use active voice often, some passive voice is fine

-   Use present tense

-   Use imperative mood

-   Use second person

-   Avoid conditional tense (Don't "shoulda-woulda-coulda" the content!)

For example:

The following except from IGC™ Help illustrates using active voice,
presenting tense, imperative mood, and second person. "You can!" "Just
do it!"

> "You can add a company or program level goal. You can roll a program
> level goal up to a company level goal. All associated program level
> goals are displayed on company level goals.
>
> Before you begin this task, make sure you have selected the correct
> context from the Company and Program strategy level drop-down on the
> Home page.
>
> To add Goals:

1.  Select the Strategy to which you are adding the Goal from the
    Strategy drop-down.

2.  Click the **Goals** tab."

Don't use future tense for things that happen right away for the user;
stay in the present.

For example:

Write this: This program level goal is displayed on the company goal
detail page.

Not this: This program level goal will be displayed on the company goal
detail page.

Only use future tense when a process is truly going to take some time.
You can use your judgment.

For example:

The import file can take a few hours to processes. A message will be
displayed in the Notifications panel when the processing finishes.

Don't use conditional tense. It is usually avoidable.

Write this: The import file can take a few hours to processes. A message
will be displayed in the Notifications panel when the processing
finishes.

Not this: The import file should process in a few hours. A message
should be displayed in the Notifications panel when the processing
finishes.
