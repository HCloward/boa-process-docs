Welcome Topic - Coming Soon Section
-----------------------------------

From time to time, PM may want to let customers know about features that
are coming soon to the IGCâ„¢ these notices go in the IGC Help Welcome
topic. PM notifies the doc team of these requests in the igc-help
channel. This section must be updated to remove the "coming soon"
reference as the features are released.
