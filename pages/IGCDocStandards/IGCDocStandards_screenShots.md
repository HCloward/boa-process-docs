Screen shots and gifs are created using the data in the Customer Success
IGC™ tenant. Refer to the following guidelines when creating screenshots
and gifs for IGC™ documentation.

### Screen Shots

Screenshots have a 1-pixel black border. For callouts, arrows, etc. use
the standard red color in the SnagIt editor. The width for arrows and
call out shapes is 1 pixel.

Try to keep screen shots narrowly focused and only show the feature or
option you are illustrating and not an entire window. This can save
content development time because you might have to update screen shots
less frequently for changes to the UI that did not affect the specific
feature or option you captured.
