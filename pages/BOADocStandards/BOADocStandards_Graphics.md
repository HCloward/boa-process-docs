## Graphics in Online Documentation

Screen shots and graphics are used sparingly in online documentation. For localization, understand that text in graphs require translation and follow the same writing guidelines as text in other online documentation.

Keep graphic source files so that it is possible to translate the text layers. Graphics software merges (flattens) text layers when you save a graphic for publishing (for example as .png or .jpg). You cannot edit or translate the text in a .png or jpg file. To keep the source text layers when using Snagit, for example, save graphics with text layers as the Snagit file format (.snag) before converting them to .png or .jpg formats.
