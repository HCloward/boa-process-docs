## Overview Topic

Users access the Overview topic "View Dashboards in \[Component Name\]" from a link in the TOC. The topic type describes dashboard content and features shared across charts in the component.

Every Dashboard Overview topic and Chart topic contains a link to this Overview topic.

The topic contains a link to all dashboards.

## Dashboard Overview Topic

This topic type:

-   Provides general information about chart content on the dashboard
-   Contains a link to each chart in the dashboard

The Dashboard Overview topic is accessed through a link in the TOC.


## Chart Topics

Each chart topic:

-   Describes chart content
-   Links to the Overview topic
-   Provides navigation steps
-   Is linked to the chart in the product when the user clicks the help icon on the chart

Navigation steps include all methods of navigation. Some charts can be accessed via an icon on a page and through a drill down from another chart. The topic describes both of these methods, as in the example below.

A chart topic lists the next level in a drill-down hierarchy with a link to that chart.

A chart topic is a link in the TOC beneath the Dashboard Overview topic.

{% include note.html content="If content is repeated in multiple chart topics, add it to the Overview topic." %}
