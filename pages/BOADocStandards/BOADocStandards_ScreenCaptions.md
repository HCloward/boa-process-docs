Screen Shots & Captions
-----------------------

Use screen shots to further illustrate steps. Place the image directly
below or to the right of the relevant point. Do **not** over use screen
shots. Adhere to the following guidelines when using screen shots.

### Formatting Guidelines

-   Place a 1-pt black border around screen shots.

-   Add a caption directly below screen shots.

-   Use the **Screen Shot** Style for standard spacing and font.

-   Use the **Caption** Style for standard spacing and font.

### Usage Guidelines

-   Take a screen shot of only the relevant data. Do not take a screen
    shot of the entire page unless absolutely necessary.

-   Include Column Headings in screen shots of the *Horizontal* View.
    Include field names in screen shots of the *Vertical* View.
