Unifying Support KB Articles and Online Help
--------------------------------------------

As we have the time, it would helpful to sync the information that we
have in the Knowledge Base articles that we have been writing for the
support team and the existing documentation in the Online Help.

### For Existing Articles

1.  Identify *Overview* Knowledge Base articles that cover broad issues
    within the DSP. Smaller articles that cover extremely specific
    support issues will probably not have a large impact on the Online
    Help and can be (mostly) disregarded.

<!-- -->

2. Check the "Refer to..." topic suggestions mentioned in the article.

3. Search the Online Help for topics that may pertain to the issues
    covered within an *Overview* article.

4. Check the field descriptions in the Online Help for icons mentioned
    in the article. Ensure that the functions described in the article
    and the Online Help are consistent in function and documentation.

5. If you find a discrepancy, create the appropriate DSP ticket
    (probably Document) in JIRA.

6. Generate the selected Online Help topics in Word using the process
    outlined in the *Editing content already in Help to send for Review*
    section of the [BackOffice Associates Solutions Documentation
    Process](https://boaweb-my.sharepoint.com/personal/michaelavon_boaweb_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=Th9D5TCGQ86Jwcpbv1Srfict%2BgsMvdhOYiZga8mbNqw%3D&docid=2_151d6dbf534bb4ba58b2e946c5e186d9e&rev=1&e=af0a398b9b0f4a65aa31790b65218b3f)
    document.

7. Edit the topics using Track Changes in Word.

8. Attach the edited topic as a Word file to the designated JIRA
    ticket.

9. Assign the ticket to a Product Manager for review and documentation
    approval.

10. Upon approval, update both the Online Help in Flare and the KB
    article.

 **NOTE**: Add a release note about the change to the appropriate What's
New topic.

11. Indicate that both have been updated in the JIRA ticket.

12. Send for Peer Review and Signoff, as usual.

### For New Articles

1.  Keep a list of references with the names of all the topics that you
    used to create your KB article.

<!-- -->

2. Check the field descriptions in the Online Help for icons mentioned
    in the article. Ensure that the functions described in the article
    and the Online Help are consistent in function and documentation.

3. When all content is approved or can go no further due to another
    discrepancy, cross reference the information provided in the KB
    article with the topics listed in your references.

4. If you find a discrepancy, contact the SMEs that are most closely
    related to the products and issues you are documenting.

5. If there is an issue with the Online Help, create the appropriate
    DSP ticket (usually Document) in JIRA.

6. Generate the selected Online Help topics in Word using the process
    outlined in the *Editing content already in Help to send for Review*
    section of the [BackOffice Associates Solutions Documentation
    Process](https://boaweb-my.sharepoint.com/personal/michaelavon_boaweb_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=Th9D5TCGQ86Jwcpbv1Srfict%2BgsMvdhOYiZga8mbNqw%3D&docid=2_151d6dbf534bb4ba58b2e946c5e186d9e&rev=1&e=af0a398b9b0f4a65aa31790b65218b3f)
    document.

7. Edit the topics using Track Changes in Word.

8. Attach the edited topic as a Word file to the designated JIRA
    ticket.

9. Assign the ticket to a Product Manager for release and
    documentation approval.

10. Upon approval, update the Online Help in Flare.

 **NOTE**: Don't forget to add a release note about the change to the
appropriate What's New topic.

11. Send for Peer Review and Signoff, as usual.
