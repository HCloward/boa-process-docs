As we have the time, it would helpful to sync the information that we have in the Knowledge Base articles that we have been writing for the support team and the existing documentation in the Online Help.

## For Existing Articles

1.  Identify *Overview* Knowledge Base articles that cover broad issues within the DSP.
    {% include note.html content="Smaller articles that cover extremely specific support issues will probably not have a large impact on the Online Help and can be (mostly) disregarded." %}

2. Check the "Refer to..." topic suggestions mentioned in the article.

3. Search the Online Help for topics that may pertain to the issues covered within an *Overview* article.

4. Check the field descriptions in the Online Help for icons mentioned in the article. Ensure that the functions described in the article and the Online Help are consistent in function and documentation.

5. If you find a discrepancy, create the appropriate DSP issue (probably Document) in JIRA.

6. Copy and paste the selected Online Help topics into a Google Doc.

7. Edit the topics using, making notes of what needs to be updated with Comments.

8. Include a link to the edited topic as a Google doc to the designated JIRA issue.

9. Assign the issue to a Product Manager for review and documentation approval.

10. Upon approval, update both the Online Help in Flare and the KB article.
    {% include note.html content="Add a release note about the change to the appropriate section of the What's New topic." %}

11. Indicate that both have been updated in the JIRA ticket.

12. Send for Peer Review and Signoff, as usual.

## For New Articles

1.  Keep a list of references with the names of all the topics that you used to create your KB article.

2. Check the field descriptions in the Online Help for icons mentioned in the article. Ensure that the functions described in the article and the Online Help are consistent in function and documentation.

3. When all content is approved or can go no further due to another discrepancy, cross reference the information provided in the KB article with the topics listed in your references.

4. If you find a discrepancy, contact the SMEs that are most closely related to the products and issues you are documenting.

5. If there is an issue with the Online Help, create the appropriate DSP issue (usually Document) in JIRA.

6. Copy and paste the selected Online Help topics into a Google doc.

7. Edit the topics using, making notes of what needs to be updated with Comments.

8. Include a link to the edited topic as a Google doc to the designated JIRA issue.

9. Assign the issue to a Product Manager for release and documentation approval.

10. Upon approval, update the Online Help in Flare.
    {% include note.html content="Don't forget to add a release note about the change to the appropriate section of the What's New topic." %}

11. Send for Peer Review and Signoff, as usual.
