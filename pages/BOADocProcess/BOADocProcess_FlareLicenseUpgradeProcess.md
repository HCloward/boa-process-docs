MadCap Flare Licensing and Upgrade Process
==========================================

The Documentation Team uses Madcap Flare to generate the online Help for
the DSP® and IGC™ products. Contact the Technical Writer Manager for the
Flare license key to install or upgrade the software and the maintenance
key to use to report problems with the Flare software.

When upgrading the software, the Technical Writer Manager assigns one
writer to upgrade and test the upgrade for Flare. The writer who tests
the upgrade performs the following checks:

-   Build each Target (including the Word target) in each Flare project
    to make sure there are no build errors

> If there are build errors export the build log and report the issue to
> Flare support.

-   Check the output to make sure that the master pages are applied
    correctly

-   Click on all clickable items and verify they work as expected (for
    example the arrow drop down menu next to the logo in the header).

-   Verify that the feedback link in the topic footer works.

-   Make sure the print and Remove Highlights icons in the Help toolbar
    work.

For the DSP Help project if everything checks out, commit a build to
source control and make sure that the Context Sensitive Help is working
as expected in a test DSP environment.

Once the build is confirmed working in the DSP test environment, notify
the Documentation Team that they can upgrade.
