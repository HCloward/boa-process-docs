Add Articles to the Knowledge Base
==================================

Refer to "Standards for Knowledge Base Articles in Zendesk" in the *BackOfffice Associates Documentation Standards* document for more information.

1.  Support adds a ticket to the DocTeamToDos board with [ Support KB ] in the title.

2.  As Technical Writers have time, they review the zendesk ticket attached to the Jira ticket and write the draft.

3.  Add the draft content to an article in zendesk here < https://support.boaweb.com/hc/en-us/categories/115001676748 >.

 **NOTE:** You must have permission to add articles. After the article has been published, you cannot update it. Contact Chris A for any required updates. https://support.boaweb.com/hc/en-us/categories/115001676748.

4.  Once the article is ready for review, assign the ticket to a Technical Writer for peer review.

5.  After peer review passes, message the SME on Slack and send them the link to the article draft in the KB.

 **NOTE:** This is likely a member of the support team, as they will understand the issue.

6.  Update comments in Jira ticket to note that SME is reviewing (include SME's name and link to draft article).

7.  Close the ticket when the article has been published.

 **NOTE:** Chris Alberts publishes all articles.
