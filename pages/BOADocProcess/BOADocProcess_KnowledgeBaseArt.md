1.  Support adds a ticket to the DocTeam ToDos Jira Kanban board with [ Support KB ] in the title.

2.  As Technical Writers have time, they assign the Support KB JIRA issues to themselves.

3. The TW reviews the ZenDesk tickets attached to the JIRA issue and writes a draft.

3.  The TW adds the draft content to an article in ZenDesk.
    {% include note.html content="You must have permission to add articles. After the article has been published, you cannot update it. Contact Chris A for any required updates." %}

4.  Once the article is ready for review, the TW assigns the ticket to another Technical Writer for peer review.

5.  After peer review passes, the TW messages Chris Alberts on Slack and sends him the link to the article draft in the KB.

6.  The TW updates the comments in the Jira issue to note that Chris Alberts is reviewing the article.

7.  The TW closes the ticket when the article has been published.
