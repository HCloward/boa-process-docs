## Incorporating User Feedback

User feedback process:

1.  Tech Writers receive an email sent from the Online Help with changes/comments.
    {% include important.html content="A feedback link is provided in the footer on every help topic. For this link to work correctly, the user's default email application must be set to Outlook using the Default Application Settings in Windows." %}

2.  TW confirms issue, then responds to confirm receipt and let the user know next steps.
3. Tech Writer adds this information to a JIRA Document issue.
   {% include note.html content="If this is not related to content (typo, missing link etc), enter the issue on the DocTeamToDos board. If the issue is related to content, add the issue as a DSP ticket." %}
4. TW assigns the issue to the PM for prioritization in the backlog, if the issue is a DSP ticket.
5. TW adds a note in the issue description that the request came from the online help feedback link, and was submitted by the consultant's name.
6. TW emails the JIRA issue number to the consultant who submitted the feedback so that person can review the release notes and know when the issue is fixed.
7. PM evaluates whether the update should be included in the Online Help and assigns a fix version as needed.
8. PM adds a note to the issue and assigns it back to the TW who entered the ticket.
9. TW updates documentation following the standard process, or closes the ticket, depending on PM feedback.
   {% include note.html content="A description of every enhancement ticket must be included in the Enhancement Requests from Users section of the What's New topic/Release Notes." %}
