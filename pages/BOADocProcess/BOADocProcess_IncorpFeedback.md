Incorporate Feedback into the Online Help
-----------------------------------------

A feedback link is provided in the footer on every help topic. A
description of every enhancement ticket must be included in the
Enhancement Requests from Users section of the What's New topic/Release
Notes.

 **NOTE**: For this link to work correctly, the user's default email
application must be set to Outlook using the Default Application
Settings in Windows.

To incorporate feedback as a result of Online Help feedback:

1.  Tech Writers receive an email sent from the OH with
    changes/comments.

2.  TW confirms issue, then responds to confirm receipt and let the user
    know next steps.

<!-- -->

3. Tech Writer adds this information to a JIRA ticket. Type is
    Document.

 **NOTE:** If this is not related to content (typo, missing link etc),
    enter the ticket on the DocTeamToDos board. If the ticket is related
    to content, add the ticket as a DSP ticket.

4. TW assigns the ticket to the PM for prioritization in the backlog
    if the ticket is a DSP ticket.

5. TW adds a note in the description that the request came from the
    online help feedback link, and was submitted by the consultant's
    name.

6. TW emails the JIRA ticket number to the consultant who submitted
    the feedback so that person can review the release notes and know
    when the issue is fixed.

7. PM evaluates whether the update should be included in the online
    Help and assigns a fix version as needed.

8. PM adds a note to the ticket and assigns it back to the TW who
    entered the ticket.

 **NOTE**: A description of every enhancement ticket must be included in
the Enhancement Requests from Users section of the What's New
topic/Release Notes.

9. TW updates documentation following the standard process, or closes
    the ticket, depending on PM feedback.
