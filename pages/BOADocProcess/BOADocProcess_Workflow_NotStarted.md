## PM Enters a Ticket in Aha! or Dev/PM/Others Add Tickets Manually in Jira

Technical Writers track all documentation content in JIRA, including:
-   New features and updates
-   All Bug issues
-   Customer Support issues
-   Other tickets (tasks, defects) that describe changes to behavior or the UI that were previously released.

{% include tip.html content="Technical Writers enter issues related to how the online help works, and unrelated to content (as in, typos, broken links, Map ID corrections) on the DocTeamToDos board in JIRA." %}

The process begins when a ticket is moved to the board for the current release.

Either:
-   PM enters the initial ticket in Aha! A Jira ticket is automatically created, or
-   PM/Dev/QE enter the ticket manually in Jira, or
-   JIRA users may also enter documentation-only issues with an Issue Type of **Document** on the DSP board.
