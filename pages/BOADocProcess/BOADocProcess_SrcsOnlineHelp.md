## Aha features/JIRA Issues

The Product Owner/PM enters new features/updates for all products in Aha!, which automatically creates a ticket in JIRA.

When creating a ticket, the reporter:

-   Completes the **Fix Version/s** field for each issue, ensuring that all issues in scope for a release have the correct version number.
- Includes information in the story ticket and associated subtasks for all issues requiring documentation.

After a product's initial release, product updates are also tracked as separate JIRA issues. To ensure that all issues in scope for the release are included in the documentation, the Technical Writer searches on the release number in the Fix Version/s field when reviewing issues for inclusion in documentation.

## Online Help

Search in the help for background information and content that can be referenced or modified when writing about updates to products.

## Meetings with Project Team Members

Content can also come from Deep Dives and meetings with Development/PM/QE.

## Development Slack Channels

Writers can also get answers from feature/product specific slack channels if one has been created, or by direct messaging the PM or lead developer listed on the JIRA ticket.

## Support and Training teams

Often the support or training teams have first-hand knowledge of how the products are used and can be helpful in supplying examples or verifying if something is accurate.
