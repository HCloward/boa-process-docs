{% include important.html content="The master branch must be updated with the latest changes at the close of each release, and a new Staging branch must be created at the beginning of every release cycle from the master branch by the Tech Writer who is handling the manuals that release cycle. Sometimes customers need manuals specific to the version of DSP that they are running, so the Staging branches must not be updated or deleted once they have been merged into the master branch." %}

## The Install Manual Process
### Manuals to Update
The following Installation Manuals are updated for each release _if there are changes to be made._
* BackOffice Associates Solutions Installation and Upgrade Manual
* BackOffice Associates Solutions Software Requirements and Hardware Sizing Guide
* SAP Accelerators by BackOffice Associates Implementation Quick Start Guide
* SAP Accelerators by BackOffice Associates Installation and Upgrade Manual
* SAP Accelerators by BackOffice Associates Operations Guide
* SAP Accelerators by BackOffice Associates Software Requirements and Hardware Sizing Guide
 
For instructions on updating Release Notes, refer to [Prepare What's New topic/Release Notes.] (#repare-what-â€™-s-new-topic-/-release-notes-content).

### Source of Content
Changes to the Installation Manuals are tracked in jira. Source of changes include:
* Other Jira tickets
* Slack 
* Chris Alberts
Pay attention to conversations and tickets to pick up on what needs to change in the Installation Manuals. It may be helpful to create the Jira ticket at the start of the release schedule as a location to store installation manual changes. 

### Organization of the InstallManuals Flare Project
The project is organized by manual. Several sections are used across multiple manuals, with conditional tags applied. 
The Version History topic (located towards the bottom of the Content Explorer, beneath all the folders) is updated in one location and used across all manuals with the most recent entry at the top.

### Update the Installation Manuals
The following steps describe the collaboration, review, approval and final formatting process to get the Installation Manuals ready for publish for each software release. 

Members of the Documentation Team rotate, taking turns to be in charge of updating the Installation Manuals for each release. 


Follow these steps to update the install manuals:
1. [The Tech Writer synchronizes her local master branch with the BackOfficeAssoc dsp-install-manuals master branch](#synchronize-your-master-branch-with-the-backofficeassoc-github-repo).
   {% include note.html content="If you do not have a local copy of the install manuals on your laptop, see [Clone the dsp-install-manuals repo](#clone-the-dsp-install-manuals-repo)." %}
2. [The TW creates a new Staging branch based on the Master branch in the dsp-install-manuals repo](#create-a-branch-for-your-updates-based-on-the-master-branch).
3. [The TW creates a release folder in OneDrive for the current release, copies the current Word files of the manuals into the new release folder, and updates the file titles](#create-a-release-folder-on-onedrive).
   {% include note.html content="The TW will include a link to this folder in the next step when they create the JIRA epic/subtasks." %}
4. [The TW creates a Jira epic for updating the manuals for this release](#create-a-jira-epic-for-the-release).
5. [The TW adds subtasks for each manual that will require updates to the release epic to track the updates](#add-subtasks-for-manuals-in-jira-epic).
5. The TW and contributors review and update the manuals in OneDrive and Flare as needed.
6.  Once the collaboration is complete and the content is final, the approver sets the **Documentation Status** field to of the installation manual epic Jira issue to **Approved**.
7.  [The TW makes the required changes in Flare and updates the **Appendix A -- Version History** section to reflect the updates made to the current version](#make-updates-in-flare).
8.  The TW sets the **Documentation Status** field of the installation manual epic Jira issue to **Peer Review** and requests a peer review from another tech writer on the team.
    {% include note.html content="See the 'Open a pull request for a peer reviewer to review your work' section of the [DSP Documentation Workflow][BOADocProcess_DSPDocWorkflow] page for more information on this process. The process for the Install Manuals is identical, except that for the install manuals the **base** branch will be the **master** branch and the **compare** branch will be the **staging** branch you are making your updates on." %}
9.  The Peer reviewer makes any necessary edits in Flare and merges the Staging branch with the Master branch.
    {% include note.html content="The reviewing tech writer does not need to review content, because collaborators must address and approve all content changes during the collaboration step." %}
    {% include note.html content="See the 'Peer Review: Peer Reviews Content in Flare' section of the [DSP Documentation Workflow][BOADocProcess_DSPDocWorkflow] page for more information on the peer review process. The process for the Install Manuals is identical, except that the content from the Staging branches should be merged with the Master branch not the develop branch." %}
10.  After the Staging branch is merged, the Tech Writer who owns the manuals for the release [updates the targets for the manuals](update-the-targets-for the-manuals), generates new Word versions and the [secured pdfs][BOADocProcess_DevManConfigGuides.html#securitysettings], saves them to the release folder, sends notification that the final manuals are ready to Support, and then closes the Jira ticket.

### Clone the dsp-install-manuals repo

To clone the dsp-install-manuals repo, follow the instructions for [cloning the dsp-docs repo][BOADocProcess_GitInitSetup], but all Staging branches should be based on the **Master** branch from this repo.
