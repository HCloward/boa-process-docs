Adding Videos to Flare Topics

Once you have recorded a video, you must have it peer-reviewed by a
fellow technical writer and technically approved by an SME (I usually
ask Ben Bauer for technical reviews). Once it has been finalized,
perform the following steps to share the video:

In Camtasia

1.  Click **Share** in the page toolbar.

2.  Select **Local File** from the drop-down list.

3.  Click **Next** in the Production Wizard pop-up window.

4.  Select the **MP4 -- Smart Player (HTML5)** option and click
    **Next**.

5.  Leave the default settings selected and click **Next**.

6.  Leave the default settings selected again and click **Next**.

7.  Type the desired name for the output file in the **Production
    name:** text box.

8.  Select a file path to which to save the video.

9.  Click **Finish**.

Zip the local file and send it to the marketing team to post on the BOA
YouTube channel.

In Flare

1.  Right-click the **Videos** folder in Resources in the Content
    Explorer.

2.  Select **New** and then select **Multimedia**.

3.  Click the **...** button next to the **New from existing:** text
    box.

4.  Select the video's file path in File Explorer.

5.  Click **Add**.

6.  Open the topic for which the video was made to complement.

7.  Find the appropriate section heading. Insert the video before the
    use case steps.

8.  Click the **Insert** tab.

9.  Click **Multimedia** and select **YouTube/Vimeo**.

10. Select the **Multimedia from Web** option.

11. Copy/Paste the hyperlink for the YouTube video in the link text box
    under the Multimedia from Web radio button. A thumbnail of the video
    will appear in the Preview area.

12. Click **OK**.

13. Click **Save**.

14. Add a note to the appropriate What's New topic(s) letting customers
    know that they have access to a new video tutorial.

> **NOTE:** The video will not display properly if the following css is
> not present in the default.css Stylesheet:
>
> video { max-width: 240px; border: 3px solid black; }
>
> video:focus { max-width: 100%; }
