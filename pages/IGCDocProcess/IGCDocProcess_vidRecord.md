Recording with Camtasia

Camtasia is a very visually-oriented video production program. Almost
everything you need to accomplish can be achieved through dragging,
dropping, and right-clicking.

Create a New Project

1.  Upon opening Camtasia, select **New Project** from the pop-up menu.
    A new project opens, but it is unnamed.

2.  Click **File** in the page toolbar.

3.  Select **Save As...**

4.  Name your project and click **Save**. Changes will not save
    automatically as you are working, so remember to go to the File menu
    and click Save each time you have made significant changes.

To avoid having to move large sections of recordings around later, start
with the introductory slide placement. Work left to right and place
recordings and slides on the timeline incrementally.

Add a Slide to Your Library

To add media, like the introductory and closing slide image, to your
library in Camtasia:

1.  Save the file somewhere that is easily accessible.

2.  Open Camtasia.

3.  Click **File**.

4.  Click **Library**.

5.  Click **Import Media to Library**.

> height="3.34375in"}

6.  Navigate to the file in the File Explorer.

7.  Click **Media** in the left sidebar menu.

8.  Click the **Library** tab.

> height="3.8645833333333335in"}

Add Text to Slides

To add text to a slide:

1.  Queue the slide you want to add text to in the preview window by
    positioning the playback line over the slide in the timeline.

> height="3.78125in"}

2.  Click **Annotations** in the left sidebar menu.

3.  Click and drag the **abc** Callout button to the position you want
    it on the slide.

> ![](media/image10.png){width="2.59375in"
> height="3.6041666666666665in"}

4.  Double-click in the middle of the text area, and the writing cursor
    line appears.

5.  Edit the text's attributes in the Properties panel that is displayed
    on the right:

> ![](media/image11.png){width="5.33333552055993in"
> height="2.3958333333333335in"}

Match the intro slide up with a brief summary of what you will cover in
your tutorial video.

Once you have created your slides, if you need to re-use them in other
videos:

1.  Open the project that has the completed slide.

2.  To group the media that comprises the slide, Shift+click each
    component of the slide (image, text, behaviors and transitions),
    right-click and select **Group Media**.

3.  Copy the slide (right-click and select Copy or Ctrl+C).

4.  Open the project in which to want to insert the slide.

5.  Paste the slide into the timeline (right-click and select Paste or
    Ctrl+V).

Name Recordings

To name recording clips and avoid confusion while editing:

1.  Click the red **Record** button to open the Camtasia Recorder.

2.  Click **Tools \> Options \> General tab**.

3.  Click the **File options** button.

4.  Click the **Ask for file name** option.

> height="0.3645833333333333in"}![](media/image13.png){width="0.9479166666666666in"
> height="0.19791666666666666in"}![](media/image14.png){width="3.75in"
> height="4.520833333333333in"}

Record each storyboard frame of audio, and then record the video. Do not
record all of the audio at once, as it becomes difficult to keep track
of. If you perfect each segment before moving onto the next, it saves
time in the long run.

Record Clips

To record video in Camtasia:

1.  Click the **Record** button; Camtasia minimizes and the Camtasia
    Recorder launches.

2.  Select the screen you want to record.

> **NOTE:** If you do a full-screen recording, record the screen of the
> smallest monitor display you have (like your laptop screen). This
> prevents the video from looking grainy when it is scaled down.

3.  Click the **Audio on** button to turn it to **Audio off**. This will
    save PC users the step of splitting and deleting the audio from the
    video recording in production.

4.  When finished recording, click the **Stop** button; the recording
    appears in the media bin.

To record audio in Camtasia:

1.  Click the **Record** button; Camtasia minimizes and the Camtasia
    Recorder launches.

2.  If using a Mac, click the toggle to disable the screen recording.

3.  Select the audio device. Use a headset microphone or a professional
    recording microphone.

5.  When finished recording, click the **Stop** button; the recording
    appears in the media bin.
