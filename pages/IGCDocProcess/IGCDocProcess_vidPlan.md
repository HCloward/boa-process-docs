IGC Video Process

Process

Planning

1.  **MAKE A STORY BOARD.** Take screenshots, make stick-figure
    sketches, or whatever you need to do to map out what you are going
    to display in your video recording. It may not seem like an
    important step, but when you are putting your audio and video
    recordings together, a storyboard will make organization and
    recording a lot easier.

2.  **WRITE A SCRIPT.** Match up sections of script to sections of the
    story board. Write short blurbs as opposed to long paragraphs, as
    they are easier to work with in production. Adhere to existing
    writing standards, but alter awkward-sounding sections to sound more
    colloquial. Accessibility is paramount in video tutorials.

3.  **HAVE THE SCRIPT PEER-REVIEWED.** Recording audio is
    time-consuming, so perfect your script as much as possible before
    recording.

Story Board and Script Template

Insert screenshots of the screen to be recorded on the left. Add the
text that will be used in the voiceover to be matched up with the video
recording on the right.

Audio Recording Considerations

-   Record video and audio separately.

-   Record whole sentences. If you mess up part of a sentence, re-record
    the whole thing. Spliced sentences sound awkward even when
    well-spliced.

<!-- -->

-   Record audio in short sections. It makes it easier to work with when
    matching it up to certain parts of your video recording.

-   Update the script after the video is complete as it is a transcript
    for the video.

-   When recording audio, set your levels for a range between -12dB to
    -6dB. When you are mixing audio in post-production and exporting,
    take care to make sure that those levels do not exceed **-6dB**,
    which is the standard.

-   Ensure that audio levels are even throughout video. Use normalize
    function or manually adjust audio levels as needed. Listen to your
    full recording in headphones when reviewing.

-   Trim pauses from the beginning and end of audio clips. It helps with
    syncing the audio and the video and removes obvious breathing noises
    and whirring fans that the mic picks up when you are not speaking.

Video Recording Considerations

-   Set up your screen recording windows to record the smallest screen
    you have (like your laptop screen), as this will improve the
    resolution of the recording. If the area you record is too large,
    the finished video will look grainy when it scales the recording
    down to a window-sized area.

-   Use slow, steady mouse movements. The video recording clip speed can
    be increased later if it is too slow, and careful movement will
    prevent the mouse cursor from looking jerky or dizzying.

-   Hide your toolbar when you record.

<!-- -->

-   Hide the address bar in the browser (F11).

-   Snooze all notifications that could interrupt recording. Microsoft
    and Slack can create noises and pop-up windows that can show up in
    your recording. Be sure to turn off all these notifications before
    starting recording.
