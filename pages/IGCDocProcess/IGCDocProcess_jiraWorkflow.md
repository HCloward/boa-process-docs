## JIRA Board
All work is tracked on the Kyber board.

## General Workflow
The Documentation team produces documentation for new features and enhancements and bug fixes. A Jira epic is opened for new features and enhancements, A Technical Writer is assigned to the teams that are developing these features and attends the weekly meetings.

## Bug Tickets
Bug tickets are tracked on the Kyber board. Technical Writers document bug tickets that affect how the user uses the project, and updates to the UI.

## DocTeamToDos
For Documentation work that is not associated with a Dev (feature or bug) ticket, open a DT ticket and track the work on the DocTeam ToDos project. Add the Entota label to the tickets. You can add comments and "@mention" SMEs and Tech Writers for reviews and peer reviews in the ticket as needed.

## Team Meetings and Slack Channels
The Dev teams have Slack channels and weekly team status meetings where tech writers can ask questions about features and get updates on pending deployments. Requests for information regarding what teams are handling which feature projects can be addressed to PM in the igc-help slack channel. You must join the appropriate Slack channels and then you can request to be added to the weekly meeting invitations in the appropriate Slack channel.

## Documentation Status Field
Use the Documentation Status field to track progress on the tickets,

-   **Not Started** --- Default value. No work has been done on the ticket
-   **In Process** --- Technical writer researches and writes draft content and adds it to the ticket or a google doc.
-   **Review** ---PM/Dev is reviewing content
-   **Approved** --- Content has been approved by PM. After UI is deployed, as announced in igc-releases Slack channel, author adds content to help and assigns to another TW for peer review.
-   **Peer Review** --- Technical Writer reviews content added to help
-   **Doc Done** --- Doc is complete. Documentation is published following the steps in Publish Entota™ Help And Publish Entota™ Release Notes

## Deployment Schedule
Entota™ QA Lead (Karen Dunson) @ mentions documentation team on Jira tickets once the ticket has passed testing. Tickets are usually deployed within 24 hours of passing testing. Some changes can be deployed as "hidden" behind a feature flag. Refer to Feature Flags and Release Darkly Process for more information. Feature Flags and Launch Darkly Process

## Launch Darkly
Launch Darkly allows Dev to release features and set a "flag" that hides the feature from certain tenants. For example, feature can be visible only on the PM tenant or the Customer Success tenants and hidden for all other customer tenants. This allows developers to release feature to be reviewed internally or only to certain clients for a first look.

The VP of Customer Success updates release darkly to make a feature visible when all parties have signed off that a feature is ready to be Generally Available (GA). This information is communicated in the igc\_feature\_deploys channel.

When a ticket on the Kyber board reaches the Done swimlane, it is deployed and the documentation for that ticket should be added to help with the date the ticket moved to Done.
