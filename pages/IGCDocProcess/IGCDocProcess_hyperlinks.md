Hyperlinks between What's New topics and Help system topics.
=============================================================

The What's New system and the Help System are generated as two separate
Help systems. This means that hyperlinks between the IGC Releases.htm
topic and topics in the Help system are linked to a Website. The
following screen shot illustrates the settings to use. Make sure to
select to have the hyperlink open in a New Window/Tab.

The format for links is:

http://general.igchelp.com/\<topicname\>.htm

**NOTE:** If you have spaces in the topic file name, you must replace
them with "%20". For example,
http://general.igchelp.com/topic%20name.htm
