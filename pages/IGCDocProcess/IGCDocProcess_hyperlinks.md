The What's New system and the Help System are generated as two separate Help systems. This means that hyperlinks between the IGC Releases.htm topic and topics in the Help system are linked to a Website. So when you create the hyperlink, select **Website** in the **Link to:** drop down. Then enter the full website address with the topic name appended to the end preceded by a hashtag. Ex. `http://general.igchelp.com/#Relationships.htm`

The format for links is: `http://general.igchelp.com/\<topicname\>.htm`
{% include note.html content="If you have spaces in the topic file name, you must replace them with '%20'. For example `http://general.igchelp.com/topic%20name.htm`." %}
